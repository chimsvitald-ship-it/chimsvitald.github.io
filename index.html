Its a cylindrical piece of metal that moves up and down inside a cylinder, driven by the explosive force of fuel combustion or other mechanisms. The piston plays a crucial role in converting chemical energy from fuel into mechanical energy it has Key Functions such as:<br>
1.Energy Conversion:Pistons convert chemical energy from fuel into mechanical energy. They harness the energy released from the combustion process and transfer it to the crankshaft, ultimately propelling the vehicle or driving a machine.<br>
2.Motion Transfer:Pistons transfer motion from the combustion chamber to the crankshaft. As the piston moves up and down, it rotates the crankshaft, which converts the reciprocating motion into rotary motion.<br>
3.Cylinder Sealing:Pistons help seal the combustion chamber, ensuring efficient combustion. The piston rings provide a tight seal between the piston and the cylinder wall, preventing combustion gases from escaping and maintaining compression.<br>

  margin-bottom:10px;">1. Reciprocating Pistons: Used in internal combustion engines, these pistons move up and down inside the cylinder, driven by the explosive force of fuel combustion.<br>
2. Axial Pistons: Used in hydraulic pumps and motors, these pistons move in an axial direction, parallel to the axis of rotation.<br></p>

<h2>Applications:</h2>

<p style="padding:15px;
